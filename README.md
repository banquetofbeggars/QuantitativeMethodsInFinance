# QuantitativeMethodsInFinance

This repo covers Carol Alexander's first book in the 'Market Risk Analysis' series: 'Quantitative Methods in Finance'.


It aims to hightlight how methods covered in the book may be implemented using Python, a far more ubiquitous language for use in the quantitative space than excel spreadsheets which accompany the book.


Frequently content covered has already been implemented in a host of well-tested and widely known third party open-source packages.
The project does not aim to reinvent the wheel at any point, but instead be used as reference material for examples of their implementation where a known implementation already exists.
